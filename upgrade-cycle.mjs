for THIS section, and it PERSISTS across resumes (so a resumed round-1 still has it): do not duplicate

\`CONTESTS DISMISSAL:\`, you MUST FIX or ESCALATE it (never silently re-add the same dismissal).

PROCEDURE:
1. Implement this section's steps. WIRE IT IN so the change is actually reachable — convert EVERY call
   site / occurrence this section owns (registered/exported/routed/bound/flagged); a half-converted
   section is NOT done. Author/extend tests per the section's Test Strategy.${GATES.testSetup ? ` If the harness is missing: ${GATES.testSetup}.` : ''}
2. RUN THE GATE until it satisfies the expectation above — build: ${GATES.build ?? '(none)'} ; tests
   scoped to this section's selector: ${GATES.test ?? '(no test gate configured)'}. Never weaken/delete
   tests to get green. SANITY-CHECK the runner really executed your unit tests (tests_run_count = 0
   means it matched NOTHING = a false green; -1 if N/A). Some runners silently ignore extra path args —
   when in doubt run one file per invocation or use the runner's --filter.
3. Do NOT chase whole-suite green — only THIS section's scoped tests matter; the rest may be intentionally
   red mid-migration. Build/lint must always pass.
4. LEAVE EVERYTHING UNSTAGED — do NOT \`git add\` content and do NOT commit. EXCEPTION: for any file you
   CREATE, run \`git -C ${REPO} add -N <file>\` (intent-to-add, so reviewers' \`git diff\` sees it; it does
   not stage content). Set unstaged_confirmed=true. The acceptance verifier stages for real on accept.

SCOPE — review ONLY this cycle's UNSTAGED work:
  \`git -C ${REPO} diff\`                    (unstaged tracked changes — review this)
  \`git -C ${REPO} status --porcelain\` then READ every NEW/untracked file (\`??\`/\`A\`) — \`git diff\` OMITS new files.

Report ONLY production-blocking defects INTRODUCED by this diff: real correctness/security/
data-integrity/error-handling/resource/concurrency/api-contract bugs, or anything that breaks the
build or tests. DROP silently: anything pre-existing in the baseline, style, naming, medium/low polish,
speculation, redesigns. An EMPTY result is the normal, GOOD outcome.

per defect — file:line, what's wrong, why it's production-blocking, a concrete fix. If none, write
exactly "No production-blocking defects found." Then return clean (true if NO findings, including no
contests) + issue_count + contested_dismissals via the schema. Do NOT modify source, stage, or commit.`;

SECTION: ${section.id} — ${section.title}   (gate: ${section.gate})

OVERRIDE: ${dismissedFile(section.id)} entries are the developer's judgment calls. You are plan-aware —
if a dismissed item ACTUALLY breaks one of this section's acceptance criteria, leaves it unreachable,
or causes a regression, that OVERRIDES the dismissal: fail acceptance for it and record it in your file.

SCOPE — this cycle's work is the UNSTAGED diff plus new files:
  \`git -C ${REPO} diff\` + \`git -C ${REPO} status --porcelain\` (READ new files).
  \`git -C ${REPO} diff --staged\` = accepted baseline (prior sections — compare against it for regressions).

PROCEDURE:
1. For EACH acceptance criterion of THIS section, find concrete evidence it holds (a diff hunk, a passing
   test, an observed behavior). Mark met / not-met with file:line / test-name / output evidence.
2. REACHABILITY: prove every integration point this section owns is satisfied — every call site
   converted, route mounted, symbol exported/bound/flagged (grep to prove it). A half-converted section
   is not done.
3. REGRESSION: compare the unstaged diff against the staged baseline; confirm no previously-accepted
   behavior was changed or broken.
4. Run this section's gate and record the real outcome (build: ${GATES.build ?? '(none)'} ; tests scoped
   to this section: ${GATES.test ?? '(none)'}). For gate=green the selector tests must PASS; for
   gate=red-baseline the authored tests must FAIL as intended (that failing test IS the spec — a valid,
   stageable "done"); for gate=build-only just build green. Do NOT treat the intentionally-red rest of
   the suite as a failure. If a configured MCP/tool is unavailable here, say so in the file (do not fake
   it) and return pass=false.
5. WRITE ${acceptanceFile(section.id, round)} (create ${STATE_DIR}/ if needed): the per-criterion table,
   the reachability + regression result, the gate output, and each gap (title + file:line + fix) — or
   "All criteria met; reachable; no regression."
6. DECIDE:
   • All criteria met, reachable, gate satisfied, no regression → \`git -C ${REPO} add <this section's
     changed AND newly-created files>\` (NEVER commit); return pass=true, staged=true. The baseline now
     advances to include this section.
   • LEGITIMATE NO-OP: if this section genuinely requires NO code change because the staged baseline

     (there is simply nothing to add). Say so explicitly in your file. Do NOT invent changes to justify it.

You are an INDEPENDENT PLAN CRITIC (read-only). The orchestrating agent decomposed a breadth-spanning
GOAL into ordered SECTIONS in plan mode. Find what the plan MISSED or got WRONG against the REAL repo —
across the WHOLE change surface — not to restyle or re-architect it. An empty result (verdict="ready")
is a GOOD outcome. Read ${PLAN_REF} (every "## Section:" block).
${ENV}

PROCEDURE:
1. RE-DERIVE the change surface YOURSELF from the goal: grep the target repo for EVERY occurrence of the
   patterns/APIs/symbols the goal replaces or touches. Do NOT trust the plan's file lists — verify them.
   Record hit counts so coverage is checkable.
2. Compare every hit + integration point against the sections. Report a GAP only for a MATERIAL miss
   WITHIN the goal: an uncovered call site/file/feature, a missing prerequisite (e.g. no test-harness
   section before a red-baseline one), a dependency-ORDERING error (a consumer section before its
   producer), an acceptance criterion with no implementing step, a test strategy that won't prove the
   criteria, or a section too big for one ~150k-token develop pass (too_big=true; name it in notes).
3. Raise a QUESTION only for something that genuinely BLOCKS safe implementation and only a human can
   resolve. Provide file:line evidence for every gap — no evidence, no gap.
Do NOT modify any files. Return your findings via the schema (the orchestrating agent acts on them).`;

PROCEDURE (read-only except step 4):
1. RE-DERIVE the change surface from the GOAL: grep the target repo for every pattern/API/symbol the goal
   replaces or touches. Any hit that should have been converted but wasn't = a gap.
2. Run the FULL gates once and record the real outcome (build: ${GATES.build ?? '(none)'} ; test:
   ${GATES.test ?? '(none)'}). If the GOAL implies whole-suite green at the end, a red suite is a gap; if
   a red tail is expected, say which failures look expected vs surprising.
3. Spot-check the staged diff (\`git -C ${REPO} diff --staged --stat\`): does it plausibly cover every
   section's acceptance? Look for suspiciously-untouched areas the GOAL names.
4. WRITE ${SWEEP_FILE}: the suite result, then each gap (title + file:line evidence + a suggested
   follow-up section) — or "No gaps found." Do NOT modify source code, stage, or commit.
Report ONLY material, in-GOAL gaps — not improvements, not pre-existing issues. Return via the schema.`;
